A large file previewer 

Most existing text editors try to load entire file when we open a very large text or CSV file.
This tool just quickly shows top lines of a file rather than loading the entire file.

Tested on Windows 7

Windows EXE installer:

Screen Shot:
Drag and drop (very large) file to preview the head of the file content.
