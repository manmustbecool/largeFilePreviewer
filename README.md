A large file previewer 

Most existing text editors try to load the entire file when we open a very large text or CSV file.
This tool just quickly shows top lines of a file rather than loading the entire file.
Support .csv .txt .gz etc. file types

Windows EXE installer:

Screenshot:
Drag and drop (very large) file to preview the head of the file content.
