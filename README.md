# A large file previewer 

Most existing text editors try to load entire file when we open a very large text or CSV file.
This tool just instantly shows top N lines of a (CSV) file rather than loading and reading the entire file.

# Screenshot:

Drag and drop (very large) file to preview the head of the file content.
